A curious alien landed their ship on earth. While wandering through a forest, the alien encounters a hungry wolf. The hungry wolf starts chasing the alien, and the alien then flees back to their spaceship, dodging obstacles, to escape in one piece. Once the alien makes it back onto its ship, the alien takes off through space back to their home planet. Once landed, the alien must then run through dangerous terrain to make it back home.
