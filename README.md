VRun is a VR integrated running game where the main character is an Alien visiting Earth for a bit of peace and tranquility (and perhaps an abductee or two), but quickly discovers the dangers of Planet Earth and must flee to return Home.

  
Playing Controls:
When your iOS device is mounted in the googleVR or phone compatible equivalent VR system (with the home button on the right-hand size), tilt your head/phone left/right to move let/right, respectively. To jump, look up or down. To stop jumping or continue running straight, look straight ahead.
